# setup

Setup is a command line tool for assuming role. You can easily manage assume role and change role anytime you want.
<br>
I recommend this tool if you are managing multiple AWS account. Easily get assume credentials and paste it to your terminal.

## Install
* If you want to use setup command, then you need to set up..
 - aws configure

```bash
$ brew tap devopsartfactory/devopsart
$ brew install setup
$ setup version
```
